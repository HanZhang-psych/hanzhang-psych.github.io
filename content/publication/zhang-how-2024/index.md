abstract: The current study examined whether the suppression of overt attention to
  a salient distractor requires attentional resources. In a feature-search task, participants
  searched for a constant shape among different shapes while ignoring a uniquely coloured
  distractor. Trial-by-trial fluctuations in attentional resources were assessed via
  thought probes that elicited mind-wandering reports and via pre-trial pupil sizes.
  The results show that initial eye movements to the distractor were suppressed regardless
  of the availability of attentional resources. However, when mind-wandering, the
  presence of the distractor prolonged target looking time. Thus, the initial deployment
  of overt attention in this task does not require attentional resources and can proceed
  automatically, presumably due to strong selection history. Nonetheless, the distractor
  might still disrupt later processing stages, an effect exacerbated by mind-wandering.
  These results also suggest that initial eye movements do not fully reflect the extent
  of distractor interference during the entire course of visual search.

abstract: 'Video lectures are increasingly prevalent, but they present challenges
  to learners. Students'' minds often wander, yet we know little about how mind wandering
  affects attention during video lectures. This paper presents two studies that examined
  eye movement patterns of mind wandering during video lectures. In the studies, mind
  wandering reports were collected by either self-caught reports or thought probes.
  Results were similar across the studies: mind wandering was associated with an increased
  allocation of fixations to the instructor''s image. For fixations on the slides,
  the average duration increased but the dispersion decreased. Moreover, preliminary
  evidence suggested that fixation duration and dispersion can diminish soon after
  self-caught reports of mind wandering. Overall, these findings help advance our
  understanding of how learners'' attention is affected during mind wandering and
  may facilitate efforts in objectively identifying mind wandering. Future research
  is needed to determine if these findings can extend to other instructional formats.'

abstract: We present PupEyes, an open-source Python package for preprocessing and
  visualizing pupil size and eye movement data. Developed with current best practices
  in mind, PupEyes offers a comprehensive and reproducible pupil preprocessing pipeline,
  as well as interactive visualizations to facilitate data exploration and outlier
  detection. In addition to pupil size data, PupEyes supports interactive visualization
  of eye movement data, including scanpath animations, fixation density plots, and
  area-of-interest (AOI) maps. It also provides tools for manually drawing AOIs, assigning
  fixations to AOIs, and computing basic AOI-based metrics. Cleaned data are returned
  as pandas data frames, making them compatible with other data analysis and visualization
  packages within the Python ecosystem. PupEyes also features an intuitive Application
  Programming Interface (API) and detailed online tutorials (https://pupeyes.readthedocs.io/),
  making it accessible to users with varying levels of programming experience. Overall,
  PupEyes (1) ensures that pupil size data are preprocessed in a principled, transparent,
  and reproducible manner, (2) helps researchers better understand their data through
  interactive visualizations, and (3) enables flexible extensions for further analysis
  tailored to specific research goals. We believe PupEyes is a useful addition to
  the analysis workflow for pupil size and eye movement data.

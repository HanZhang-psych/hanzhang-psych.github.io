abstract: Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are generally
  distractible. Yet, the precise relationship between ADHD and distractibility remains
  under-specified in two respects. First, different sources of distraction, such as
  background noise or mind wandering, may not be equally associated with ADHD. Second,
  ADHD itself comprises a variety of symptoms that show considerable heterogeneity
  and it is unclear which ADHD symptoms are associated with which type of distraction.
  The current study addresses these questions using one clinically evaluated sample
  (N=69) and two large non-clinically evaluated samples (N=569, N=651). In all samples,
  participants completed questionnaires about their susceptibility to external distraction,
  unwanted intrusive thoughts, spontaneous mind-wandering and ADHD symptomatology.
  Traditional regression and novel network analyses revealed an overwhelming contribution
  of spontaneous mind-wandering in explaining ADHD symptoms, although external distraction
  and unwanted intrusive thoughts were also associated with a small number of ADHD
  symptoms. Findings support a growing body of literature linking spontaneous mind-wandering
  and ADHD, and they highlight the heterogeneity in the association between ADHD symptoms
  and different sources of distraction.

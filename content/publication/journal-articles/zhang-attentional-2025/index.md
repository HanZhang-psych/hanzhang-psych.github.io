abstract: The study of attentional allocation due to external stimulation has a long
  history in psychology. Early research by Yantis and Jonides suggested that abrupt
  onsets constitute a unique class of stimuli that captures attention in a stimulus-driven
  fashion unless attention is proactively directed elsewhere. Since then, the study
  of visual attention has evolved significantly. This article revisits the core conclusions
  by Yantis and Jonides in light of subsequent findings and highlights emerging issues
  for future investigation. These issues include clarifying key concepts of visual
  attention, adopting measures with greater spatiotemporal precision, exploring how
  past experiences modulate the effects of abrupt onsets, and understanding individual
  differences in attentional allocation. Addressing these issues is challenging but
  crucial, and we offer some perspectives on how one might choose to study these issues
  going forward. Finally, we call for more investigation into abrupt onsets. Perhaps
  due to their strong potential to capture attention, abrupt onsets are often set
  aside in pursuit of other conditions that show attenuation of distractor interference.
  However, given their real-world relevance, abrupt onsets represent the exact type
  of stimuli that we need to study more to connect laboratory attention research to
  real life. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

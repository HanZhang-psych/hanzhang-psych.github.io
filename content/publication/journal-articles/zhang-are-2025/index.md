abstract: Abrupt onsets are commonly assumed to be a class of stimuli with high physical
  salience. This high salience has been used to explain past findings showing abrupt
  onsets captured attention more strongly compared to other types of distractors,
  such as color singletons. However, there has been a lack of consensus about the
  definition and measurement of physical salience. As a result, it is unclear if abrupt
  onsets capture attention more strongly simply because they are more salient than
  other types of stimuli. Using a psychophysical technique recently developed by Stilwell
  et al. (2023), we explicitly quantified the level of physical salience of abrupt
  onsets, color singletons, and color singleton onsets. Surprisingly, abrupt onsets
  were the least salient among the three types of items examined. Despite this, only
  abrupt onsets captured attention in a subsequent visual search task, whereas color
  singletons and color singleton onsets were both suppressed. Thus, abrupt onsets
  tend to capture attention more strongly than color singletons, but this is not apparently
  because of high physical salience. Indeed, high physical salience may make an object
  easier to suppress during visual search. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA,

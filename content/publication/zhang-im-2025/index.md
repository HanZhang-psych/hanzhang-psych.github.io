abstract: 'Purpose: Reading involves a remarkable coordination of perceptual and linguistic
  processes. This coordination is reflected by a close coupling between reading eye
  movements and lexical properties of words, such as word frequency and predictability,
  as well as morpho-syntactic and semantic regularities. Yet, reading is also subject
  to interference, and a common source of interference is when others are speaking
  nearby. Then, how does irrelevant speech affect reading as reflected in eye movements?
  Method: Fifty-nine participants (mean age: 19, 25 females, 34 males, primary language:
  English) read passages from the PROVO corpus (Luke &amp; Christianson, 2018) under
  intelligible irrelevant speech or silence, with eye movements recorded. We investigated
  how irrelevant speech influences the link between eye movements and several indicators
  of lexical difficulty: word frequency, cloze probability (exact-word predictability),
  large-language-model-generated surprisal, morpho-syntactic predictability (part-of-speech
  and inflection), and semantic predictability (general meaning). Results: Relationships
  between these lexical variables and eye movements remained robust during first-pass
  reading and were unaffected by irrelevant speech, suggesting intact lexical and
  syntactic processing during early stages of reading. However, disruption emerged
  in later eye-movement measures (i.e., total viewing time), where low-frequency and
  semantically unpredictable words prompted increased re-reading under irrelevant
  speech. Conclusion: These results indicate that intelligible irrelevant speech selectively
  interferes with post-lexical, higher-order semantic integration. The increased re-reading
  of rare and semantically unpredictable words suggests that readers compensate by
  revisiting these words to repair difficulties in integrating their meanings into
  a coherent understanding of the text.'

abstract: Experimental manipulations in conflict tasks, e.g., the Stroop, Flanker,
  and Simon tasks, lead to systematically poorer performance in “incongruent” conditions
  that feature stimuli that contradict task goals. However, substantial recent debate
  surrounds whether individual differences in conflict task behavior reflect reliable,
  trait-like mechanistic processes. Much prior work uses difference scores, contrasting
  performance between incongruent and congruent trials to index conflict suppression
  ability, but recent work demonstrates these scores exhibit poor psychometric properties.
  Formal cognitive process models suggest that individual differences in conflict
  suppression are driven by task-general processes, as opposed to processes specialized
  for conflict. However, this prior work separately models cognitive process parameters
  and their covariation, which fails to adequately account for measurement error.
  Here, we model distinct mechanisms of conflict task performance and their covariance
  simultaneously using hierarchical Bayesian joint modeling methods for the first
  time which improves individual estimation and accounts for error. We fit the conflict
  linear ballistic accumulator model (LBA) to two large datasets containing multiple
  conflict tasks and test-retest sessions, and an additional large dataset containing
  a conflict task and simple perceptual decision-making task. First, within conflict
  tasks, we found moderate test-retest reliability for both conflict-specific processing
  mechanisms, and, to a larger degree, task-general mechanisms. Second, task-general,
  but not conflict-specific, mechanisms were correlated across different conflict
  tasks. Third, these task-general mechanisms were correlated between conflict tasks
  and a simple decision-making task without conflict suppression demands. Overall,
  we found robust individual differences in computational mechanisms underlying general
  decision-making, but not mechanisms specific to conflict processing.

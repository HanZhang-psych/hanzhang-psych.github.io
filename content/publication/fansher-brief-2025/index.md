abstract: Prior research suggests that people often misunderstand visualizations of
  inflow (e.g., deposits in a banking context) and accumulation (e.g., cumulative
  savings) in dynamic systems. The present study aimed to examine participants’ understanding
  of accumulation functions and to develop and test the effectiveness of video-based
  interventions for improving understanding of accumulation. In Experiment 1, we tested
  the effectiveness of an intervention seated in the context of understanding COVID-19
  data. In Experiment 2, we addressed several limitations of Experiment 1 and developed
  an improved, more general intervention to teach about accumulation in contexts outside
  of epidemiological data. The two randomized control experiments demonstrated that
  people fail to understand even simple systems with a single inflow that accumulates
  over time, with 44%–60% of participants earning a 0% on our pretest measure. However,
  we also demonstrated that video-based interventions illustrating the relationship
  between multiple representations of the same underlying data are an effective way
  to improve the understanding of the relationship between inflow and accumulation,
  with Experiment 1 suggesting that the effects of our intervention lasted up to 6–7
  weeks after testing. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

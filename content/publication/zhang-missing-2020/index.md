abstract: 'Mind-wandering (i.e., thoughts irrelevant to the current task) occurs frequently
  during reading. The current study examined whether mind-wandering was associated
  with reduced rereading when the reader read the so-called garden-path jokes. In
  a garden-path joke, the reader’s initial interpretation is violated by the final
  punchline, and the violation creates a semantic incongruity that needs to be resolved
  (e.g., “My girlfriend has read so many negative things about smoking. Therefore,
  she decided to quit reading.”). Rereading text prior to the punchline can help resolve
  the incongruity. In a main study and a preregistered replication, participants read
  jokes and nonfunny controls embedded in filler texts and responded to thought probes
  that assessed intentional and unintentional mind-wandering. Results were consistent
  across the two studies: When the reader was not mind-wandering, jokes elicited more
  rereading (from the punchline) than the nonfunny controls did, and had a recall
  advantage over the nonfunny controls. During mind-wandering, however, the additional
  eye movement processing and the recall advantage of jokes were generally reduced.
  These results show that mind-wandering is associated with reduced rereading, which
  is important for resolving higher level comprehension difficulties. (PsycInfo Database

abstract: The current research looked at how listening to music affects eye movements
  when college students read natural passages for comprehension. Two studies found
  that effects of music depend on both frequency of the word and dynamics of the music.
  Study 1 showed that lexical and linguistic features of the text remained highly
  robust predictors of looking times, even in the music condition. However, under
  music exposure, (a) readers produced more rereading, and (b) gaze duration on words
  with very low frequency were less predicted by word length, suggesting disrupted
  sublexical processing. Study 2 showed that these effects were exacerbated for a
  short period as soon as a new song came into play. Our results suggested that word
  recognition generally stayed on track despite music exposure and that extensive
  rereading can, to some extent, compensate for disruption. However, an irrelevant
  auditory signal may impair sublexical processing of low-frequency words during first-pass
  reading, especially when the auditory signal changes dramatically. These eye movement
  patterns are different from those observed in some other scenarios in which reading
  comprehension is impaired, including mindless reading. (PsycInfo Database Record

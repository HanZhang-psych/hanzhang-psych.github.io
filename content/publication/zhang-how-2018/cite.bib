 abstract = {The current research looked at how listening to music affects eye movements when college students read natural passages for comprehension. Two studies found that effects of music depend on both frequency of the word and dynamics of the music. Study 1 showed that lexical and linguistic features of the text remained highly robust predictors of looking times, even in the music condition. However, under music exposure, (a) readers produced more rereading, and (b) gaze duration on words with very low frequency were less predicted by word length, suggesting disrupted sublexical processing. Study 2 showed that these effects were exacerbated for a short period as soon as a new song came into play. Our results suggested that word recognition generally stayed on track despite music exposure and that extensive rereading can, to some extent, compensate for disruption. However, an irrelevant auditory signal may impair sublexical processing of low-frequency words during first-pass reading, especially when the auditory signal changes dramatically. These eye movement patterns are different from those observed in some other scenarios in which reading comprehension is impaired, including mindless reading.

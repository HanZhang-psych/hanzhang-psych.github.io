abstract: Researchers have long debated how humans select relevant objects amid physically
  salient distractions. An increasingly popular view holds that the key to avoiding
  distractions lies in suppressing the attentional priority of a salient distractor.
  However, the precise mechanisms of distractor suppression remain elusive. Because
  the computation of attentional priority is a time-dependent process, distractor
  suppression must be understood within these temporal dynamics. In four experiments,
  we tracked the temporal dynamics of visual attention using a novel forced-response
  method, by which participants were required to express their latent attentional
  priority at varying processing times via saccades. We show that attention could
  be biased either toward or away from a salient distractor depending on the timing
  of observation, with these temporal dynamics varying substantially across experiments.
  These dynamics were explained by a computational model assuming the distractor and
  target priority signals arrive asynchronously in time and with different influences
  on saccadic behavior. The model suggests that distractor signal suppression can
  be achieved via a “slow” mechanism in which the distractor priority signal dictates
  saccadic behavior until a late-arriving priority signal overrides it, or a “fast”
  mechanism which directly suppresses the distractor priority signal’s behavioral
  expression. The two mechanisms are temporally dissociable and can work collaboratively,
  resulting in time-dependent patterns of attentional allocation. The current work
  underscores the importance of considering the temporal dynamics of visual attention
  and provides a computational architecture for understanding the mechanisms of distractor
  suppression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2025 APA, all rights reserved)

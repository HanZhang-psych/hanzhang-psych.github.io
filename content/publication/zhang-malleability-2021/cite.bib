 abstract = {We suggest that consideration of trial-by-trial variations, individual diﬀerences, and training data will enrich the current framework in Luck, S. J., Gaspelin, N., Folk, C. L., Remington, R. W., & Theeuwes, J. (2020. Progress toward resolving the attentional capture debate. Visual Cognition, 1–21. https://doi.org/10.1080/13506285.2020.1848949). We consider whether attentional capture is modulated by trial-by-trial ﬂuctuations of attentional state and experiences on the previous trial. We also consider whether individual diﬀerences may aﬀect attentional capture while highlighting potential challenges in using the colour-singleton task to measure individual diﬀerences. Finally, performance in the colour-singleton task can be modiﬁed dramatically with practice but the underlying mechanisms are not entirely clear. Understanding the malleability of attentional capture may broaden the current framework and resolve outstanding questions.},

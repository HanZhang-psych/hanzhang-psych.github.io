abstract: IntroductionAdults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)
  are generally distractible. Yet, the precise relationship between ADHD and distractibility
  remains under-specified in two respects. First, different sources of distraction,
  such as background noise or mind wandering, may not be equally associated with ADHD.
  Second, ADHD itself comprises a variety of symptoms that show considerable heterogeneity
  and it is unclear which ADHD symptoms are associated with which type of distraction.MethodsThe
  current study addresses these questions using one clinically evaluated sample (N = 69)
  and two large non-clinically evaluated samples (N = 569, N = 651). In all samples,
  participants completed questionnaires about their susceptibility to external distraction,
  unwanted intrusive thoughts, spontaneous mind-wandering and ADHD symptomatology.ResultsTraditional
  regression and novel network analyses revealed an overwhelming contribution of spontaneous
  mind-wandering in explaining ADHD symptoms, although external distraction and unwanted
  intrusive thoughts were also associated with a small number of ADHD symptoms.DiscussionFindings
  support a growing body of literature linking spontaneous mind-wandering and ADHD,
  and they highlight the heterogeneity in the association between ADHD symptoms and
  different sources of distraction.

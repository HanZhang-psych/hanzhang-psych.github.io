abstract: It is well documented that ADHD is associated with challenges in inhibitory
  control.  However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms that give rise to these difficulties
  are not well established. Here, we employ a novel “forced-response” method with
  computational modeling to disentangle the time-dependent control of habitual and
  goal-directed processing in response-conflict tasks in adults with ADHD. We use
  a converging approach which compares individuals with ADHD against neurotypical
  individuals and individuals with ADHD off medication against on medication on two
  conflict tasks (Simon and Flanker). The forced-response method tracks moment-to-moment
  cognitive processing from stimulus to response, and data from this method was modeled
  using a computational model that distinguishes the temporal dynamics of habitual
  and goal-directed processes. Converging results revealed that ADHD was associated
  with delayed goal-directed processing but not rushed habitual processing when compared
  to both neurotypical individuals and to the same individuals on medication in both
  conflict tasks. These findings mark an important step toward elucidating the underlying
  mechanisms that lead to real-life challenges in inhibiting distracting information
  in adults with ADHD.

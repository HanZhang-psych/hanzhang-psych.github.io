abstract: Effective visual search relies on reactively disengaging from distractors
  when the features of the distractors are unpredictable. Does this ability differ
  between adults with and without Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?.
  Participants (36 with ADHD, 46 non-ADHD) completed the additional-singleton task,
  in which they searched for a unique shape while a uniquely coloured distractor unpredictably
  appeared on half of the trials. The distractor delayed manual response times in
  both groups, with no significant group difference. Both groups also demonstrated
  similar oculomotor capture effects, as indicated by the landing position of initial
  fixations. However, when initial fixations did land on the distractor, participants
  with ADHD tended to “linger” on the distractor with additional fixations and longer
  duration before disengaging from it, compared to those without ADHD. These results
  suggest that ADHD is associated with deficits in reactively disengaging from distractions
  rather than deficits in avoiding being captured in the first place.

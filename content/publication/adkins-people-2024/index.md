abstract: Humans tend to slow down after making an error. A longstanding account of
  this post-error slowing is that people are simply more cautious. However, accuracy
  typically does not improve following an error, leading some researchers to suggest
  that an initial ‘orienting’ response may initially impair performance immediately
  following error. Unfortunately, characterizing the nature of this error-based impairment
  remains a challenge in standard tasks that use free response times. By exerting
  control over the timing of responses, we reveal the time course of stimulus-response
  processing. Participants are less accurate after an error even when given ample
  time to make a response. A computational model of response preparation rules out
  the possibility that errors lead to slower cognitive processing. Instead, we find
  that the efficacy of cognitive processing in producing an intended response is impaired
  following errors. Following an error, participants commit more slips of action that
  tend to be a repetition of the previous mistake. Rather than a strategic shift along
  a single speed-accuracy tradeoff function, post-error slowing observed in free response
  time tasks may be an adaptive response to impaired cognitive processing that reflects
  an altered relationship between the speed and accuracy of responses. People tend
  to be more cautious and slow down their responses after making a mistake. Paradoxically,
  this doesn’t always lead to performance improvement. Here, the authors show that,
  even when given ample time, people are still more error-prone after they have already
  committed an error.

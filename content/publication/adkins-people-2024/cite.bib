 abstract = {Humans tend to slow down after making an error. A longstanding account of this post-error slowing is that people are simply more cautious. However, accuracy typically does not improve following an error, leading some researchers to suggest that an initial ‘orienting’ response may initially impair performance immediately following error. Unfortunately, characterizing the nature of this error-based impairment remains a challenge in standard tasks that use free response times. By exerting control over the timing of responses, we reveal the time course of stimulus-response processing. Participants are less accurate after an error even when given ample time to make a response. A computational model of response preparation rules out the possibility that errors lead to slower cognitive processing. Instead, we find that the efficacy of cognitive processing in producing an intended response is impaired following errors. Following an error, participants commit more slips of action that tend to be a repetition of the previous mistake. Rather than a strategic shift along a single speed-accuracy tradeoff function, post-error slowing observed in free response time tasks may be an adaptive response to impaired cognitive processing that reflects an altered relationship between the speed and accuracy of responses. People tend to be more cautious and slow down their responses after making a mistake. Paradoxically, this doesn’t always lead to performance improvement. Here, the authors show that, even when given ample time, people are still more error-prone after they have already committed an error.},

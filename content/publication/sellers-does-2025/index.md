abstract: A long-standing debate in the study of cognitive aging concerns whether
  aging results in a selective deficit in inhibitory control beyond a general slowing
  of cognitive processing. Previous studies have obtained mixed findings, in part
  because the typical free response time paradigm lacks the specificity required to
  disentangle component processes underlying inhibitory control. Here, we apply a
  novel forced-response paradigm and a computational model to disentangle these processes
  to test if aging results in overall speed differences or a selective deficit in
  inhibitory control. 50 older adults and 57 younger adults completed a “forced-response”
  arrow flanker task. We find strong evidence that older adults demonstrate a global
  slowing of processing, without any selective deficit in inhibitory control. Furthermore,
  we demonstrate global slowing is sufficient to explain the mixed findings in previous
  free RT studies. Overall, these results highlight the utility of using a theory-informed,
  fine-grained approach to study inhibitory control.

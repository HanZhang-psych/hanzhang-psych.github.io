abstract: On April 13, 2021, the CDC announced that the administration of Johnson
  and Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine would be paused due to a rare blood clotting side
  effect in ~ 0.0001% of people given the vaccine. Most people who are hesitant to
  get a COVID-19 vaccine list potential side effects as their main concern (PEW, 2021);
  thus, it is likely that this announcement increased vaccine hesitancy among the
  American public. Two days after the CDC’s announcement, we administered a survey
  to a group of 2,046 Americans to assess their changes in attitudes toward COVID19
  vaccines. The aim of this study was to investigate whether viewing icon arrays of
  side effect risk would prevent increases in COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy due to the
  announcement. We found that using icon arrays to illustrate the small chance of
  experiencing the blood clotting side effect significantly prevented increases in
  aversion toward the Johnson and Johnson vaccine as well as all other COVID-19 vaccines.

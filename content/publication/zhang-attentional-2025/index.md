abstract: The study of attentional allocation due to external stimulation has a long
  history in psychology. Since the early work by Yantis and Jonides, there has been
  a growing and consistent interest in the effect of abrupt visual onsets on such
  attentional allocation. Yantis and Jonides concluded that abrupt onsets constitute
  a possibly unique class of stimuli that captures attention in a stimulus-driven
  fashion, unless attention is proactively directed elsewhere. Since then, the field
  of visual search has evolved significantly. This article revisits the core conclusions
  by Yantis and Jonides in light of subsequent evidence and highlights emerging issues
  for future investigation. We argue that perhaps due to their strong potential to
  capture attention, abrupt onsets are often set aside as a special case in pursuit
  of conditions that show attenuation of capture by other types of distractors, such
  as color singletons. However, given their prevalence in real life, abrupt onsets
  represent the exact type of stimuli that we need to study more to understand the
  mechanisms of attentional guidance, including whether abrupt onsets can be suppressed.
  We also propose using methods that more precisely measure the temporal and spatial
  dynamics of visual attention beyond making binary judgments about whether attention
  is captured or not. We provide an example, the forced-response method, that might
  be suitable for this endeavor.

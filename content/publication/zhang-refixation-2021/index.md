abstract: 'Recent studies have shown that mind-wandering (MW) is associated with changes
  in eye movement parameters, but have not explored how MW affects the sequential
  pattern of eye movements involved in making sense of complex visual information.
  Eye movements naturally unfold over time and this process may reveal novel information
  about cognitive processing during MW. The current study used Recurrence Quantification
  Analysis (Anderson, Bischof, Laidlaw, Risko, & Kingstone, 2013) to describe the
  pattern of refixations (fixations directed to previously inspected regions) during
  MW. Participants completed a real-world scene encoding task and responded to thought
  probes assessing intentional and unintentional MW. Both types of MW were associated
  with worse memory of the scenes. More important, RQA showed that scanpaths during
  unintentional MW were more repetitive than during on-task episodes, as indicated
  by a higher recurrence rate and more stereotypical fixation sequences. This increased
  repetitiveness suggests an adaptive response to processing failures through reexamining
  previous locations. Moreover, this increased repetitiveness contributed to fixations
  focusing on a smaller spatial scale of the stimuli. Finally, we were also able to
  validate several traditional measures: both intentional and unintentional MW were
  associated with fewer and longer fixations; eye-blinking increased numerically during
  both types of MW but the difference was only significant for unintentional MW. Overall,
  the results advanced our understanding of how visual processing is affected during
  MW by highlighting the sequential aspect of eye movements. (PsycInfo Database Record

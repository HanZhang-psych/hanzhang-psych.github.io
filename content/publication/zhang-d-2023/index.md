abstract: 'People differ substantially in their vulnerability to distraction. Yet,
  many types of distractions exist, from external stimulation to internal thoughts.
  How should we characterize individual differences in their distractibility? Two
  samples of adult participants (total N = 1220) completed a large battery of questionnaires
  assessing different facets of real-world distractibility. Latent modeling revealed
  that these measures could be explained by three correlated-yet-distinct factors:
  external distraction, unwanted intrusive thoughts, and mind-wandering. Importantly,
  about 80% of the total variance in these three factors could be explained by a single
  higher-order factor (d) that could be construed in terms of a personâ€™s general distractibility,
  and this general distractibility model was replicated across the two samples. We
  then applied the general distractibility model to understand the nature of ADHD
  symptomatology and hyperfocus (an intense state of long-lasting and highly focused
  attention). d was substantially associated with self-reported ADHD symptoms. Interestingly,
  d was also positively associated with hyperfocus, suggesting that hyperfocus may,
  to some degree, reflect attention problems. These results also show marked consistencies
  across the two samples. Overall, the study provides an important step toward a comprehensive
  understanding of individual differences in distractibility and related constructs.'

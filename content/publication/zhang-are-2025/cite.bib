 abstract = {Abrupt onsets, such as the sudden appearance of a pedestrian on one side of the road, are prevalent in daily life and seem to be a powerful force in capturing our attention. What gives abrupt onsets such a powerful ability to capture our attention? One common assumption is that they are highly salient. We quantiﬁed the level of physical salience of abrupt onsets and found that they were, in fact, less salient compared to color singletons (a uniquely colored item). Despite this, abrupt onsets captured attention in a visual search task when they served as distractors, whereas color singleton distractors did not. Therefore, abrupt onsets indeed strongly capture attention, but this is not necessarily because they are physically salient. These results may help us understand why abrupt onsets capture our attention.},

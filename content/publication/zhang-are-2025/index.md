abstract: Abrupt onsets, such as the sudden appearance of a pedestrian on one side
  of the road, are prevalent in daily life and seem to be a powerful force in capturing
  our attention. What gives abrupt onsets such a powerful ability to capture our attention?
  One common assumption is that they are highly salient. We quantiÔ¨Åed the level of
  physical salience of abrupt onsets and found that they were, in fact, less salient
  compared to color singletons (a uniquely colored item). Despite this, abrupt onsets
  captured attention in a visual search task when they served as distractors, whereas
  color singleton distractors did not. Therefore, abrupt onsets indeed strongly capture
  attention, but this is not necessarily because they are physically salient. These
  results may help us understand why abrupt onsets capture our attention.

## Description

This unique course was taught to both students from the University of Michigan and students from Beijing Normal University, as part of a cultural and academic exchange program between the two universities from 2015 to 2019. As a graduate student instructor, I trained US and Chinese students on research methods including survey methodology, experimental design, and mobile eye-tracking. I supervised both US and Chinese students on their joint research projects, worked with them on group presentations, and organized cultural exchange activities.

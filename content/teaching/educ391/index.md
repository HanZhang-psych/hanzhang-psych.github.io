## Description

As a primary instructor, I taught a weekly 3-hour seminar to fourteen students who were prospective elementary school teachers on the topic of cognitive, social, and emotional development in elementary school settings. The goal of this course is to train students to use psychological theories and principles to improve their teaching practice and promote student learning. I was responsible for the entire course preparation. Additionally, I held office hours, graded student exams and essays, and supervised group presentations.

## Description

In this upper-level writing course, students were divided into groups to conduct research projects using research methods learned during class. As a long-time graduate student instructor for this course, I guided almost 100 students through the entire process of research: formulating hypotheses, designing studies, collecting and analyzing data, and scientific writing. I provided hands-on training on research methods including computer programming (R), eye-tracking, survey methodology, and experimental design, depending on the specific project of each group. I also reviewed each student's essays and provided critical feedback.

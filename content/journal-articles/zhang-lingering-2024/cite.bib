 abstract = {Effective visual search relies on reactively disengaging from distractors when the features of the distractors are unpredictable. Does this ability differ between adults with and without Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?. Participants (36 with ADHD, 46 non-ADHD) completed the additional-singleton task, in which they searched for a unique shape while a uniquely coloured distractor unpredictably appeared on half of the trials. The distractor delayed manual response times in both groups, with no significant group difference. Both groups also demonstrated similar oculomotor capture effects, as indicated by the landing position of initial fixations. However, when initial fixations did land on the distractor, participants with ADHD tended to “linger” on the distractor with additional fixations and longer duration before disengaging from it, compared to those without ADHD. These results suggest that ADHD is associated with deficits in reactively disengaging from distractions rather than deficits in avoiding being captured in the first place.},

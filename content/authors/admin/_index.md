#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a cognitive psychologist working in the transportation domain. I have extensive experience investigating cognitive processes relevant to driving behavior, including visual perception, attention, and cognitive control. I have examined these issues in young and older adults as well as individuals with ADHD. My goal is to translate basic understandings about human cognition into practical solutions for improving driving safety.

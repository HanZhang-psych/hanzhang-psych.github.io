	abstract = {Experimental manipulations in conflict tasks, e.g., the Stroop, Flanker, and Simon tasks, lead to systematically poorer performance in “incongruent” conditions that feature stimuli that contradict task goals. However, substantial recent debate surrounds whether individual differences in conflict task behavior reflect reliable, trait-like mechanistic processes. Much prior work uses difference scores, contrasting performance between incongruent and congruent trials to index conflict suppression ability, but recent work demonstrates these scores exhibit poor psychometric properties. Formal cognitive process models suggest that individual differences in conflict suppression are driven by task-general processes, as opposed to processes specialized for conflict. However, this prior work separately models cognitive process parameters and their covariation, which fails to adequately account for measurement error. Here, we model distinct mechanisms of conflict task performance and their covariance simultaneously using hierarchical Bayesian joint modeling methods for the first time which improves individual estimation and accounts for error. We fit the conflict linear ballistic accumulator model ({LBA}) to two large datasets containing multiple conflict tasks and test-retest sessions, and an additional large dataset containing a conflict task and simple perceptual decision-making task. First, within conflict tasks, we found moderate test-retest reliability for both conflict-specific processing mechanisms, and, to a larger degree, task-general mechanisms. Second, task-general, but not conflict-specific, mechanisms were correlated across different conflict tasks. Third, these task-general mechanisms were correlated between conflict tasks and a simple decision-making task without conflict suppression demands. Overall, we found robust individual differences in computational mechanisms underlying general decision-making, but not mechanisms specific to conflict processing.},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/gnxjw_v1},
	abstract = {Purpose: Reading involves a remarkable coordination of perceptual and linguistic processes. This coordination is reflected by a close coupling between reading eye movements and lexical properties of words, such as word frequency and predictability, as well as morpho-syntactic and semantic regularities. Yet, reading is also subject to interference, and a common source of interference is when others are speaking nearby. Then, how does irrelevant speech affect reading as reflected in eye movements? Method: Fifty-nine participants (mean age: 19, 25 females, 34 males, primary language: English) read passages from the {PROVO} corpus (Luke \&amp; Christianson, 2018) under intelligible irrelevant speech or silence, with eye movements recorded. We investigated how irrelevant speech influences the link between eye movements and several indicators of lexical difficulty: word frequency, cloze probability (exact-word predictability), large-language-model-generated surprisal, morpho-syntactic predictability (part-of-speech and inflection), and semantic predictability (general meaning). Results: Relationships between these lexical variables and eye movements remained robust during first-pass reading and were unaffected by irrelevant speech, suggesting intact lexical and syntactic processing during early stages of reading. However, disruption emerged in later eye-movement measures (i.e., total viewing time), where low-frequency and semantically unpredictable words prompted increased re-reading under irrelevant speech. Conclusion: These results indicate that intelligible irrelevant speech selectively interferes with post-lexical, higher-order semantic integration. The increased re-reading of rare and semantically unpredictable words suggests that readers compensate by revisiting these words to repair difficulties in integrating their meanings into a coherent understanding of the text.},

	abstract = {It is well documented that {ADHD} is associated with challenges in inhibitory control.  However, the underlying cognitive mechanisms that give rise to these difficulties are not well established. Here, we employ a novel “forced-response” method with computational modeling to disentangle the time-dependent control of habitual and goal-directed processing in response-conflict tasks in adults with {ADHD}. We use a converging approach which compares individuals with {ADHD} against neurotypical individuals and individuals with {ADHD} off medication against on medication on two conflict tasks (Simon and Flanker). The forced-response method tracks moment-to-moment cognitive processing from stimulus to response, and data from this method was modeled using a computational model that distinguishes the temporal dynamics of habitual and goal-directed processes. Converging results revealed that {ADHD} was associated with delayed goal-directed processing but not rushed habitual processing when compared to both neurotypical individuals and to the same individuals on medication in both conflict tasks. These findings mark an important step toward elucidating the underlying mechanisms that lead to real-life challenges in inhibiting distracting information in adults with {ADHD}.},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/w7fp9_v1},
	abstract = {A long-standing debate in the study of cognitive aging concerns whether aging results in a selective deficit in inhibitory control beyond a general slowing of cognitive processing. Previous studies have obtained mixed findings, in part because the typical free response time paradigm lacks the specificity required to disentangle component processes underlying inhibitory control. Here, we apply a novel forced-response paradigm and a computational model to disentangle these processes to test if aging results in overall speed differences or a selective deficit in inhibitory control. 50 older adults and 57 younger adults completed a “forced-response” arrow flanker task. We find strong evidence that older adults demonstrate a global slowing of processing, without any selective deficit in inhibitory control. Furthermore, we demonstrate global slowing is sufficient to explain the mixed findings in previous free {RT} studies. Overall, these results highlight the utility of using a theory-informed, fine-grained approach to study inhibitory control.},
